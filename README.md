# Developer Survey Data Wrangling & Feature Engineering Pipeline

This project demonstrates a full end-to-end data preprocessing pipeline applied to real developer survey data.

## Key Capabilities
- Inconsistency detection and correction  
- High-missingness feature pruning  
- Median and mode-based imputation strategies  
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables  
- Feature scaling using Min-Max normalization  
- Log transformations for skewed compensation data  
- Feature engineering using experience-level bucketing  

## Business Value
Real-world datasets are incomplete, inconsistent, and highly skewed.  
This pipeline prepares raw survey data for downstream analytics and machine learning workflows.

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib
